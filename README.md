# kisa.co
This is the repository of the mobile app project named kisa.co - a link shortener for the Cloud Computing Course (CS443). Kisa.Co is written in Dart/Flutter framework, therefore it can be run on both iOS and Android Mobile devices.


## A short Description

kisa.co is a link-shortener application available for iOS and Android. The application takes user-provided URLs and transforms them into shortened URLs. Original URLs can be accessed via their shortened aliases. 

The mobile application makes HTTP requests to our API endpoints and will receive their generated URLs. Authenticated users can provide a custom expiration date and the view count limit. Authenticated users can also generate private URLs. A selected 'Private mode' will ensure that the generated URL is hardly predictable (it will also have a longer URL length). 

The system also provides link analytics for the user to see their URLs view count and the location of these views in terms of IP address and country information. These analytics regarding shortened URLs could be seen by authenticated users on a separate information panel. 



Below are some screenshots from the application (on the iPhone11 Pro Simulator).
